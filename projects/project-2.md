#Technical Debt in Practice
<img class="ui medium floated rounded image" src="../images/TechDebt.jpg">

I am in the final throes of writing a book on Technical Debt.  The proposed title of the book is "Technical Debt in Practice" and it is being co-authored by Julien Delange (Twitter) and Neil Ernst (University of Victoria).  We expect to publish this delightful book of wit and wisdom in early 2020.
