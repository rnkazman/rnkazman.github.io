I am in the final throes of writing a book on Technical Debt.  The proposed title of the book is "Technical Debt in Practice" and it is being co-authored by Julien Delange (Twitter) and Neil Ernst (University of Victoria).  We expect to publish this delightful book of wit and wisdom in early 2020.  It will be published by MIT Press.
